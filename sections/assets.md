Assets
===============

Assets are the visual elements of the pass.

Passworks supports 6 types of assets (`icon`, `logo`, `strip`, `thumbnail`, `background` and `footer`) each type of passe uses one or more assets.

You can reuse your assets, meaning that you can assign the same asset to multiple passes.
